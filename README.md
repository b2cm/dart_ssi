This Branch contains a script to estimate the execution-costs of the used SmartContracts 
(ERC1056 and the Revocation-Contract) in euro. The script is called cost_estimation.dart and
could be found in the examples directory.
Run it with `dart examples/cost_estimation.dart`.

The only purpose of this branch is the aforementioned script, so this branch would never be merged to master.
